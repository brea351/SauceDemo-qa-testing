 SauceDemo E-Commerce Automation (Cypress) 
 
 An End-to-End QA Automation project validating the complete shopping workflow of the SauceDemo e-commerce web application. This project demonstrates professional QA practices, leveraging Cypress, Node.js, and the Page Object Model (POM) for robust and maintainable tests running effectively within a CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins).
 
 Project Objectives & Scope
 
     Category,Scope of Testing
    
 Authentication,"Valid login, invalid login scenarios, and secure logout."
 Product Inventory,"Verifying product details, pricing, and functionality of sorting options."
 Cart Management,"Adding and removing products, and confirming cart badge updates."
 Checkout Flow,Successful checkout (customer information) and validation of required error messages.
 Order Confirmation,Verification of the final confirmation message and order completion state.
 Cross-Browser,Automated testing across Chrome and Firefox (via Cypress configuration).
 Tools & Frameworks
 The automation solution is built on modern, open-source JavaScript-based technologies:
    Language: JavaScript / TypeScript (Implicitly used by Cypress)
    Automation: Cypress (Test Runner and Framework)
    Test Runner: Cypress
    Reporting: Mochawesome and JUnit (for Jenkins integration)
    Project Manager: Node.js / npm
    Test Artifacts: Excel (for manual test case documentation)
    Defect Tracking: GitHub / Jira
    
     Project Structure (Page Object Model)
    The project adheres to the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for high reusability and maintainability.saucedemo-automation/
