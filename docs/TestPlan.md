- Validate the core functionalities of the SauceDemo web application.  
- Ensure end-to-end e-commerce workflows (**Login ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Checkout**) work as expected.  
- Identify and report defects in functionality, usability, and performance.  
- Automate regression scenarios to ensure continuous stability.

## 4. Test Approach

### Testing Types
- **Functional Testing**: Validate all workflows manually.  
- **Regression Testing**: Automate high-priority flows using Selenium/Pytest.  
- **Negative Testing**: Invalid inputs, empty fields, incorrect credentials.  
- **UI/UX Testing**: Layout, error messages, and responsiveness.  
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Basic validation in Chrome and Firefox.  
- **(Optional) API Testing**: If API endpoints are available for data.  
- **(Optional) Performance Testing**: Simulate multiple users via JMeter.  

### Test Design Techniques
- **Equivalence Partitioning & Boundary Value Analysis** (for form fields).  
- **Decision Table Testing** (for login variations).  
- **Scenario-Based Testing** (for checkout flow).
